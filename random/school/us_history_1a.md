**Unit 1: Creating a Nation** -> 1492 (Columbus reaches the Americas) - 1877 (End of Reconstruction) -> Covers Chapter 1


1 . How did geography influence the ways Native Americans cultures developed?

Geography determined the resources the Native Americans had access to. They established an array of cultures suited to their environments. For example, in the Eastern Woodlands, most Native Americans combined hunting and fishing with farming. While those living in Southwestern regions, people mostly did just farming various crops such as corn, beans, and cotton.

2. What drove some European rulers to send explorers in search of a water route to Asia?

They wanted to find a quick trade route to Asia as Asia was the source of many luxury goods. Various European rulers wanted to bypass the Italian and Arab merchants and traders who controlled trade in the eastern Mediterranean. 

3. For what reasons were the thirteen colonies founded?

For economic gains, escaping persecution for religious beliefs, religious freedom, and a different system of governance. 

4. Why did the colonies fight a war for independence against Great Britain?

The colonists wanted a new, independent government for themselves as they felt the British rule was very oppressive. Also, the American colonists didn't like the policies Britain adopted to solve its (Britain's) financial problems. For the colonists, they were being taxed left, right, and center. Hence, they fought for independence against Great Britain. 

5. What are the key compromises and provisions incorporated in the U.S. Constitution?

The key comprises in the U.S. Constitution would be the Great Comprise and the Three-Fifths Comprise. The key provisions in the U.S. Constitution would be the Bill of Rights, First Admendment, Fourth Admendment, Fifth Admendment, Ninth Admendment, Thirteenth Admendment and the Fourteenth Admendment. 

6. Why did political parties emerge in the new republic, and what were the consequences?

There was a clash of interest that led to political parties to emerge. The issue was the debate over Hamilton's financial program. Some supported the plans, while others didn't. The consequences after Jefferson became president would be the size of the country increased (land that belongs to the U.S.), federal debt was being paid off, government spending drastically reduced, etc. But the most important consequence (I believe) would be the fact that it became recognized that the Court had the power to declare laws unconstitutional and invalid. 

7. How is the legislative branch organized, and what are its functions?

The legislative branch includes the two houses of Congress: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The legislative branch's primary responsibilities are to make the nation's laws and to decide how to spend federal funds. The Congress also monitors the executive branch and investigates possible abuses of power. The House of Representatives can impeach any federal official it suspects of wrongdoing or misconduct. The Senate acts as a court and tries the accused official. The Senate also has the power to ratify treaties made by the president and confirm presidential appointments of federal officials. The legislative branch naturally checks on both the judicial branch and the executive branch. 

8. How does the president carry out laws that Congress passes?

The executive branch carries out the laws that Congress passes. And the president is responsible for carrying out the nation's laws. The president must carry out the laws that Congress passes as it is executive order. The president may veto the bill, but if two-thirds of the House and Senate vote to approve it, it becomes a law without the president's approval. The EOP (Executive Office of the President) assists the president by giving the president advice and information before certain actions are carried out. 

9. How did life in the North change in the early 1800's?

The North experienced massive growth in both population and economy. Millions of people moved to the North, mostly immigrants, to work in factories. Comparing with the South, the North was rapidly growing in all aspects. Slavery in the North was also very minimal comparing with the South. 

10. How would you evaluate the "Age of Jackson"?

The "Age of Jackson" was very interesting. I would evaluate any "period" or "age" by how well it improved the lives of ordinary people. Based on what occurred during the Age of Jackson, President Jackson wanted ordinary citizens to play a role in government. He also wanted to make the government more inclusive. But I believe that the Age of Jackson was not a fruitful one and here's why. President Jackson showed little regard for the Constitution, his extremely poor treatment of Native Americans and African Americans, and closure of the Bank of the United States (American dollar became weaker) makes his duration of presidency unappealing. Hence, I would say that the Age of Jackson didn't go very well.   

11. What common characteristics did reform movements of this era share?

I believe the most common characteristics reform movements of the era shared would form a better society and helping people who didn't have a voice have a voice. For example, women's rights, reform of prisons, asylums, and schools, and abolitionism. People such as women, children, mentally ill, prisoners, and African Americans had almost no voice in society. These reform movements, however, gave them a voice to raise concerns to improve society as a whole. 

12. What were the advantages and disadvantages for the North and the South at the start of the war?

The advantages of the North at the start of the war were: Had economic power, had a much larger population than the South, 90 percent of the nation's factories were in the North (provided troops with ammunition and other supplies), the South had only half as many miles of railroad track as the North which allowed Northern troops to easily disrupt the Southern rail system (this prevented the movement of supplies and troops), Confederacy's financial situation was already poor. The advantages of the South at the start of the war were: Many of the best officers in the United States were from the South, were fighting on familiar grounds, and the South was massive and this meant the Northern soldiers had to conquer a huge area of land. 

13. Why were Vicksburg and Gettysburg turning points in the war?

Victory over Vicksburg cut the Confederacy in two. The defeat at Gettysburg, however, ended the South's only chance of a military victory.













**Unit Two: Settling the West and Industrialization** -> 1865 (American Civil War ends) - 1901 (A new century begins) -> Covers Chapters 2 and 3

1 . Why was cattle ranching an important business for the Great Plains?

The lure of the Great Plains brought other Americans west to herd cattle. Cattle ranching was the main source of income for many Americans in the Great Plains. Though many initially had little incentive to round up the longhorns and move them to the market because (1) beef prices were low and (2) it wasn't practical to move cattle to the eastern markets. This was prior to the Civil War, however. During the war, there was a huge demand for cattle in the East in order to feed their Union armies. Hence, the cattle prices soared after the Civil War and because of railroad, the ranchers could move/send their cattle to the East. They could sell the longhorns for a huge profit in the eastern markets. Thus, cattle ranching was an important business in the Great Plains as it was a very good source of income. 

2. What developments of the late 1800's attracted settlers to endure the hardships of the Great Plains?

 New farming techniques, tools, and railroads for transportation of goods. Plains farmers were using steel plows, threshing machines, seed drills, and reapers. New farming techniques, such as dry farming, allowed farmers to still grow crops by planting the seeds deep in the ground where there is enough moisture. But without the help of the new tools, dry farming wouldn't be possible. And tools such as mechanical reapers and steam tractors made it easier to harvest a large crop. 

3. How did the arrival of new settlers affect the Plains Indians?

The settlers who migrated to the Plains deprived Native Americans of their hunting grounds, broke treaties that guaranteed them land, and often forced them to move. This made the Native Americans get infuriated, and they attacked settlers' property and occasionally going to war with them.

4. What were two significant factors in the growth of the U.S. industry?

The human resources (a large workforce) available to American industry and the abundance of raw materials enabled the U.S. to industrialize rapidly.

5. Which invention do you think had the most lasting influence?

I believe electricity had the most lasting influence as an invention. Without electricity, so many things in the modern world will just be utterly useless pieces of junk. And we won't have bulbs. 

6. How did laisses-faire economics encourage businesses to industrialize?

Part of what attracted entrepreneurs to invest in American business was society's and government's support of laissez-faire. This allowed many people of high ability and ambition into business. This made the United States to industrialize rapidly. The laissez-faire system creates a free market with competing companies, which leads to encouraging business to be more efficient. And in order to be more efficient, you need to industrialize.

7. How did the transcontinental railroad transform the West?

The transcontinental railroad linked the nation. Railroads increased the markets for many products, which resulted in industrial growth. The transcontinental railroad transformed the West by allowing the transportation of goods such as cattle to the East. Before, for many Americans in Great Plains (and the West), transportation to the East was inefficient and expensive. The transcontinental railroad boosted the economy of the West. The transcontinental railroad also closed the American frontier. 

8. How did government grants to build railroads result in large-scale corruption?

 In order to encourage railroad construction across the Great Plains, the federal government gave land grants to many railroad companies. The great wealth many railroad entrepreneurs gained were said to be because they swindled investors and taxpayers, bribed officials, and cheated on their contracts and debts. And most big investors bribed the congress to get more grants. And these companies were set up by several stockholders. To convince Congress to give railroad more grants, stockholders sold members of Congress shares at a price well below their market value. The grants led to large-scale corruption indeed. 

9. What advantages do large corporations have over small businesses?

Large corporations could invest in new technologies, hire large workforces, and purchase machines. This greatly increased their efficiency. Big corporations compared with small business had several unbeatable advantages. They could produce more goods at a lower cost, could stay open in bad economic times, and had rebates from the railroads, which lowered their operating costs. 

10. Why did workers try to form unions in the late 1800's?

Workers from unions in the late 1800s because they believed they needed a union to bargain for higher wages and better working conditions. 






















**Unit Three: Urban America** -> 1865 (American Civil War ends) - 1896 ("separate but equal" doctrine legalized) -> Covers Chapter 4

1. How did the experience of immigrating to the United States compare for Chinese and Europeans?

The Europeans could speedily enter the United States after they passed the medical inspections at Ellis island. The Chinese, however, were held for months at Angel Island to get approval to enter the U.S. Also, the Chinese Exclusion Act barred Chinese immigration for 10 years and prevented Chinese already in the United States from becoming citizens. This made it extremely difficult for Chinese immigrants specifically. Both Chinese and European immigrants faced the Immigration Act of 1882, which imposed a head tax on each immigrant who arrived by ship at a U.S. port. As we can see, the Chinese immigrants had the most difficulty in immigrating to the U.S. than the Europeans. 

2. How do you think life in the big cities was different from life on farms and in small towns?

 People in cities lived very close together, while people in rural areas lived farther apart. People living in the cities had access to electric lights, running water, modern plumbing, as well as attractions such as theaters, museums, and libraries. Also, the modes of transportation in the city differed from those in rural areas (cycling and walking excluded). In the cities, there were horsecars, cable cars, electric trolley cars, and subway systems. In the rural areas, the people still probably used carts, horse wagons, and horses as modes of transportation. However, city living was probably quite risky as there were high risks of crime, violence, fire, disease, and pollution. 


3. Why did "political machines" develop in cities?

Political machines were informal political groups that gained and kept power. Political machines developed in the cities because immigrants and new arrivals in cities needed services, jobs, and police protection. In exchange for votes, political machines and the party bosses who ran them eagerly provided these necessities.

4. What was the main idea of Social Darwinism, and how did it compare with the idea of individualism?

Social Darwinism is a philosophy based on Charles Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection, asserting that humans have developed through competition and natural selection with only the strongest surviving. Applying this in life, if a poor person is poor, it is because he/she isn't fit enough to survive and the reason he's poor is that of natural selection. In terms of international affairs, nations that were competing, only the strongest could survive. Individualism, however, is the belief that no matter what a person's background is, he or she can still become successful through effort. So a poor person can rise in society and, as far as his talents and commitments would take him. Social Darwinism is almost completely opposite to individualism. 



5. Why do you think artists and writers started portraying America more realistically?

I believe artists and writers started portraying America more realistically because of many influences. The realist style was based on the many characteristics of the era, such as clothing styles, social relationships, the differences between the social classes, and the way people looked doing ordinary things in life. These artists wanted to portray ordinary people doing ordinary things. Writers want to capture the world as they saw it. They reflected the cultural changes of American society. 

6. Why was civil service reform needed?

The civil service reform was needed as many Americans believed that patronage made the government inefficient and corrupt. The Pendleton Act required that some government jobs be filled by competitive written exams, rather than by patronage. The civil service reform gave jobs based on their qualifications rather than on political affiliation. This not only removed corruption, but gave people more opportunities. 

7. What kinds of problems did farmers face?

Farmers faced various kinds of problems. High tariffs made it hard for farmers to sell their goods overseas. Also, mortgages with large banks and rail shipping costs continued to increase. Dealing with deflation was one problem that hit farmers really badly. They had to sell their crops for less and then had to borrow money for seed and other supplies to plant their next crops. Besides that, interest rates were increasing, which increased the amount farmers owed. Farmers' incomes were already very low. Farmers faced mainly economic problems. But also natural disasters such as prairie fires which destroyed countless of crops. 

8. How did African Americans resist racism and try to improve their way of life following Reconstruction?

The African American community responded to violence and discrimination in several ways. Many African Americans left the rural South for Kansas, hoping to improve their chances of success. While others fought for civil rights and used strategies such as holding crusades, leading boycotts, peaceful protests and marches, civil disobedience, rallies, and concentrating on achieving economic goals rather than political ones. 

9. What laws did Southern states pass to impose segregation and deny African Americans their voting rights?

The 15th amendment prohibits states from denying citizens the right to vote based on "race, color, or previous condition of servitude". Mississippi imposed a poll tax of $2 in order to register to vote. This automatically prevented poor African Americans and whites from voting. Southern states passed laws that rigidly enforced discrimination. These laws became known as Jim Crow laws. Also, the Supreme Court overturned the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Because of this overruling, the Southern states passed a series of laws establishing racial segregation in almost all public places. In the Supreme Court case of Pless v. Ferguson, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation was legal and not a violation of the 14th Amendment. This caused segregation and discrimination to worsen in the Southern states.

10. What are the different ways African American community leaders responded to legalized segregation?

 Ida B. Wells crusaded against lynching and published a book denouncing mob violence and demanded "a fair trial by law for those accused of crime, and punishment by law after honest conviction". Mary Church Terrell worked against lynching, racism, and sexism by founding the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Women Wage Earner's Association. She led a boycott against department stores in Washington D.C. that refused to serve African Americans. Booker T. Washington concentrated on achieving economic goals rather than legal and political ones. W. E. B. Du Bois was concerned with protecting legal and voting rights.




**Unit Four: Becoming a World Power and the Progressive Movement** -> 1872 (Ulysses S. Grant reelected as President) - 1920 (Women gain the right to vote) -> Covers Chapters 5 and 6

1. Why did the United States look to the Pacific for new markets? 

Economic and military competition from Europe and a growing feeling of cultural superiority convinced many Americans that the United States should become a world superpower. Americans had expanded the nation by moving westward. Hence, when looking overseas for new markets, the United States naturally looked to the Pacific (west of the U.S.).

2. What events led to the war with Spain in 1898? 

The immediate cause of the Spanish-American War was Cuba's struggle for independence from Spain. Major American newspapers exaggerated the whole issue (yellow journalism) which sparked humanitarian concerns among Americans. The explosion of the battleship USS Maine created jingoism among Americans. On top of that, the U.S. supported Cuba in their decision to be an independent nation. These events/factors contributed significantly to the Spanish-American War. 

3. How was the Spanish-American War different from earlier U.S. wars?

 As we've read about various wars in the previous chapters, the former wars were primarily for American independence (American Revolution), slavery (Civil War), or extension of territory (Mexican War). The Spanish-American War can be said to be the first imperial war by the United States. It also marked the beginning of the USA becoming an empire. 

4. How did the Open Door policy help prevent any one nations from monopolizing trade with China?

The open door policy is a policy that allowed each foreign nation in China to trade freely in the other nations' spheres of influence. 
Countries such as Russia, Germany, France, and Britain wanted "leaseholds" in China. The land still belonged to China, but a foreign government would maintain overall control (economic). This resulted in each leasehold to become the center of a country's sphere of influence. American were worried that China would be divided among the Europeans and Americans wouldn't be allowed to do business in China. The Open Door policy allowed all countries to trade with China no matter what. This prevented one nation (in this case European countries) from monopolizing trade with China. 

5. What are the major reasons that the United States want to build a can through Central America?

There are several important reasons the United States wanted to build a canal through Central America. (1) It would save time and money for commercial and military shipping. (2) It would link the Atlantic and the Pacific. (3) And it was vital to the U.S. power in the world as America wanted to be able to compete with other countries economically. 
 
6. How did "moral diplomacy" shape President Wilson's foreign policy? 

Wilson opposed imperialism to the core, as he believed that democracy was essential to a nation's stability and prosperity. He eagerly wanted the U.S. to promote democracy to create a world free of war and revolution. As the book states, he hoped the United States would lead by moral example, but his first international crisis thwarted that hope. 

7. What was the primary goal of Progressive Era muckrakers?

The muckrakers were a group of journalists who investigated social conditions and political corruption. They were among the first to articulate progressive ideas. Their primary goal was to expose the injustices in the society and to expose corruption and wrongdoing in established institutions.

8. How did the Progressives support the women's suffrage movement? 

The woman suffrage movement was quite slow as the movement split into two groups at some point in time. Progressives argued that women's suffrage wasn't unfeminine and immoral. Progressives supported the women's suffrage movement because they believe it would help advance the goals of the Progressive movement. Women suffragists created associations. Few ways progressives supported women suffrage would be through lobbying, organizing events, handing out pamphlets, and delivering speeches. 

9. What problems did social-welfare programs attempt to reform? 

They wanted to encourage the government to enact social policies to improve work on crime, illiteracy, alcohol abuse, child labor, and health and safety of Americans. They pushed for laws that would ease these issues. 

10. Which approach did Roosevelt take toward regulating big business? 

He convinced the Congress to create the Department of Commerce and Labor. This department's job was to investigate holding companies and large cooperations. This gave Roosevelt the ability to regulate big business without having to sacrifice economic efficiency by breaking up the trusts. He pushed for certain acts, such as the Hepburn Act, so that it could help strengthen the Interstate Commerce Commission and take on trusts. He wasn't fully against big business organizations, but he also knew that the monopoly power of some trusts hurt the public interest. So, he limited powers of big business at the same time, not completely destroying or busting trusts completely.

11. How did President Taft's beliefs differ from the progressives' beliefs? 

There were two kinds of Republicans, the progressive and the conservative type. The progressive favored tariff reduction/ lower tariffs while the conservatives wanted to maintain high tariffs. President Taft's support for tariff reduction was predominantly low. He signed into law the Payne-Aldrich Tariff, which hardly cut tariffs at all and in fact actually raised them on some goods. He also fired Pinchot and replaced Pinchot with a very aggressive conservative, Ballinger. These two actions immensely angered progressives. I believe that President Taft was far too conservative (for progressives) and almost had complete opposite beliefs from the progressives.

12. What do you believe were Progressives most important success and biggest failure?

I believe Progressivism's most important successes would be limiting child labor, enforcing health and safety codes, women's suffrage, and making government more efficient and democratic. The biggest failures would be its failure to address racial and religious discrimination.  






**Unit Five: World War and its Aftermath** -> 1914 (World War I begins) - 1920 (Palmer Raids continue) -> Covers Chapter 7


1. How did the complex web of European alliances contribute to the outbreak of World War I?

Countries within an alliance were loyal to each other. So when one country had a conflict with another, it led to allied countries having conflicts with other allied countries. Therefore, naturally when European countries were entangled in alliances, conflicts were bond to happen.The Triple Alliance (Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary) alarmed the Russians, and Russia and Austria-Hungary were competing for influence in southeastern Europe. France and Russia opposed Germany and Austria-Hungary, which led the two countries to form an alliance called the Franco-Russian Alliance. Germany was building a large modern navy, and this threatened Britain, so Britain built closer ties with France and Russia. This informal alliance became known as the Triple Ente. So the Triple Ente as against the Triple Alliance and the Triple Alliance was against the Triple Ente. If anyone country felt threatened by an "opposing country", a war will erupt (whether it is small or big).

2. How did Germany's use of unrestricted submarine warfare bring the United States into World War I? 

A German U-boat had sunk the British passenger ship (the Lusitania) at a great loss of life. Unrestricted submarine warfare was suspended following public outcry in the US, but was reinstated in 1917. This eventually led to the American declaration of war on Germany. 

3. What were some new agencies that Congress established to help manage wartime economy?

The War Industries Board was to coordinate the purchase of war supplies. The organization encouraged companies to use mass-production techniques to increase efficiency and urged them to eliminate waste by standardizing products. The Food Administration was the responsible agency for the administration of the U.S. Army overseas and allies' food reserves National War Labor Board (NWLB) in April 1918. The NWLB often pressured industry to improve wages, adopt an eight-hour workday, and allow unions the right to organize and bargain collectively.

4. How did progressive ideas influence the roles of women during World War I? 

 Women were now seen as able to work in the workforce. After the war, women who worked could now support themselves without getting married to a man. Women no longer had to be stay-at-home parent or housewives.

5. What new technologies were introduced in World War I, and how did they impact the war? 

Poison gas was the first to be used and so were aircraft in World War 1. Armored tanks also came out during WW1, but it was too slow and unreliable to revolutionize warfare. Two new types of warfare came into action: chemical warfare and trench warfare. Also, powerful artillery guns (machine guns) could kill the enemy at a much faster rate than any weapon at the time. Also, you could shoot from a far range/distance, which proved helpful. The new technologies impacted the war significantly. On both sides, it resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of men with very little achievement.

6. How did the arrival of American troops affect German attitudes about the war? 

Nearly two million American troops marched into the Western Front. Even though the American troops were inexperienced, they were determined and eager to fight. As the Americans arrived, many in Germany concluded that the war was lost. I believe German attitudes about the war weren't at all optimistic as the number of American troops was a substantial number for the Germans. 

7. How did Wilson's perspective on the best outcome of the peace process differ from those of European leaders?

France and Britain wanted to make Germany pay for the suffering they put Europe through. And Britain refused to give up its sizable naval advantage. For the Europeans, it would mean that no nation should keep territory from another nation. This required the Central Powers to evacuate all invaded countries and Germany to restore the French territory of Alsace-Lorraine (taken in 1871). For these Europeans in particular, they would've felt that all their energy was wasted and there wasn't a point in starting a war in the first place! 

8. Why did the number of strikes increase after the war?

Workers wanted higher wages to keep up with the rapid inflation but companies resisted as inflation was also driving their operating costs. Because business raised prices on goods that they had been forced to keep low, rapid inflation occurred.  

9. Do you think the events of 1919 justified Palmer's actions? Why or why not?

The postal service intercepted over 30 parcels containing homemade bombs addressed to prominent Americans. One of these bombs damaged the home of attorney general A. Mitchell Palmer. The evidence of the incident pointed to no single group and Palmer's agents targeted the foreign-born. Because of the Red Scare which resulted from the Palmer raids, many linked radicalism with immigrants. This was clearly not fair. I believe that the events of 1919 do not justify Palmer's actions. For he was extremely biased in his actions.
