## Internet Archive - Librarian Merge Queue Project (Open Library)

In this project which is still ongoing, I did the following:

  - Add a second pager above the [merge request table](https://openlibrary.org/merges) which can be seen [here](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/6781).
  - Made entries in the [merge request table](https://openlibrary.org/merges) be displayed in descending order which can be see [here](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/6780).
