## Out With The Old, In With The New

Hello everybody! This site/blog will be my new official homepage and "home" on the internet. My other old site was way too "trashy".

My blog posts will hopefully be about:

- Firefox 🦊
- Ornithology and bird photography 🪺
- Environmental science 🌲🐾
- Gaming (Nethack and Nintendo games) 🕹
- School 📚
- Fencing 🤺
- Economics 📈 📉
- Old Hollywood (yes...I know right?) 🎞
- Food (who doesn't like good food?) 🍳
- And other miscellaneous and random musings of mine ✏️

Hope you enjoy reading my blog posts. I may in the future create a weekly or monthly newsletter for those who want to subscribe ;)
