Below is the almost complete catalog of the physical books I own. I enjoy learning new things and one of the ways I do so is by reading books. 

Do note, there isn't any particular order in the list.

The Fountainhead 

Making Music With Computers: Creative Programming In Python

Classic Westerns: Zane Grey
