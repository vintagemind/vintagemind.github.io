## Bookshelf

Below is a catalog of physical books (and very few eBooks) that I own. This isn't all the books I own but just the notable ones. I enjoy learning new things and one of the ways I do so is by reading books. Do note, there isn't any particular order in the list. Those that are physical books are labelled as [p] and those that are eBooks are labelled [e].
