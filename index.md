## About Me

I am Bithiah Koshy, a sophomore at Texas Tech High School ([Texas Tech University K-12](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/k12/)). I am a [hobbyist programmer](https://open.kattis.com/users/vintagemind), into ornithology, ex-competitive [Australian national fencer](https://www.ausfencing.org/biography/afb-2550/), and a curious person without showing it. 

Interested in fields related to computer science, web engineering, decentralization, and browser security (also anything to do with browsers). In my spare time I like to go bushwalking and bird cataloguing. Some of my more esoteric hobbies include watching classical Hollywood cinema and stamp collecting (quite difficult but I have a decent number of stamps!). A fun fact about me would be I only write in cursive (Palmer Method), unless in special circumstances.

You can find me in the following places: [Medium](https://medium.com/@vintagemind%22%3EMedium), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/16327123/vintagemind%22%3EStackoverflow), [Mozilla](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/user/VintageMind), and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-u8sNr9bZpf0SLW7r-FqeA).

### Sporting History

#### Fencing

I have been fencing since I was 10 years old and I am a professional foilist (though I can fence sabre). My biggest achievements so far would be getting two national medals in the Australian National Junior (U20) Championships. I achieved silver medal in Womens' Sabre Team and bronze medal in Womens' Foil Team. I have won numerous Victorian state and state championship medals in foil U15, U17, U20 age groups over the years.   


#### Track and Field & Cross-Country

In 2018 and 2019, I managed to get into the EMR finals (above divisions and below state) for both track and field (800m and 1500m) and cross-country (3km).
All the events, districts, divisions, and regions competitions I have participated where hosted by [Sports School Victoria](https://www.ssv.vic.edu.au/ ) (SSV).


In cross-country events, in order to be qualified for the next level competition, you must be top 10 into divions and regional competitions. In track and field, in order to be qualified for the next level competition, you must place first or second. 
In cross-country, I have consistently been placed top 5 (occasional second and third place). In track and field events, I have consistentlyl been placed second (except for one first place in 800m).



### Miscellaneous 

As of now, I have a cumulative grade point average of 4.0 on a 4.0 scale.


I was part of the [National Junior Honor Society](https://www.njhs.us/) (NJHS) from 2020 to 2022.
